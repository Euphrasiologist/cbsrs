# `cbsrs`

The `cbsrs` crate implements the Circular Binary Segmentation algorithm (1) based on code from (2).

It exposes an extremely simple API, as a trait which operates only on `Vec<usize>`.

```rust
use cbsrs::CBS;

let steps: Vec<usize> = vec![1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 300, 310, 321, 310, 299];

let shuffles = 1000;
let p = 0.05;

let res = steps.cbs(shuffles, p).unwrap();

for (start, end) in res.iter() {
  println!("{start}-{end}");
}
```

This implementation omits the 'validation' algorithm seen in other implementations.
